### Abstract
The referenced article studies the stabilization of an unstable linear oscillator by means of random impulses. Almost sure exponential stability is proved for some combination of the parameter values. The article remarks that it is not possible to obtain almost sure stability for the nonlinear situation. My goal is to understand the mathematical background of the article and with the given tools provided by the Wolfram Mathematica, reproduce some of the simulation results presented in the article.
